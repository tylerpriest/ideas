It is present now, and has been present throughout your entire life.\n\nAwareness is the constant factor in all experience. Every thought, feeling, sensation, and perception appears in and is known by awareness. While the content of experience is always changing, awareness itself remains unchanged. It is the still, silent presence behind and within all experience.\n\nYou cannot step outside of awareness to examine it as an object. Awareness is the knowing itself, not something that is known. It is closer to you than any thought, because it is what you are prior to all thinking.",

This is not because awareness doesn't exist, but because it is not an object. It is the subject—the knowing presence that is looking. Just as the eye cannot see itself directly, awareness cannot be objectified.\n\nYet awareness is self-knowing. It knows itself through being itself. You don't need to think about awareness to be aware. The simple recognition 'I am aware' is awareness knowing itself directly.",

What if the happiness and peace you seek are already present as the nature of your being? This is not a belief to adopt, but a recognition to be confirmed through investigation.\n\nWhen seeking ceases, not through suppression but through recognition, what remains is the natural happiness and peace of being.

How can you acquire what you have never lost? The pathless path recognizes that there is no distance to travel. You are already home.

They create the conditions in which recognition is more likely to occur.\n\nAs celebration, practices become an expression of recognition rather than a means to achieve it.
